# Analyzing Emotional States and Cognitive Load of Team Athletes Using EEG Signals

## Overview
This repository contains code, data, and documentation for the research project **"Analyzing Emotional States and Cognitive Load of Team Athletes During Competition Using EEG Signals."** The project introduces a novel framework leveraging **EEG signals** to achieve continuous, objective, and high-resolution tracking of emotional and cognitive states in athletes.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment-Aware Transformer Network (SATN):** Captures complex interactions between emotional states and competition dynamics.
- **Emotion-Driven Optimization (EDO):** Enhances sentiment weighting, transfer learning, and context-aware error correction.
- **EEG-Based Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides high-resolution insights into athlete cognition and emotion.
- **Improved Performance Metrics:** Demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability over traditional methods.

## Motivation
Traditional methods like self-reports and observational techniques often suffer from **subjectivity, time delays, and lack of granularity**. Our approach overcomes these limitations by integrating deep learning models with EEG signal analysis to provide **real-time, objective, and high-resolution** tracking.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:**
   - EEG signals recorded from athletes during competitive scenarios.
   - Annotations based on external and self-reported assessments.
   
2. **Model Architecture:**
   - **Sentiment-Aware Transformer Network (SATN)** for dynamic emotional state modeling.
   - **Emotion-Driven Optimization (EDO)** for enhanced sentiment weighting and transfer learning.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared to baseline approaches.
   - Insights into athletesâ€™ performance under varying conditions.
